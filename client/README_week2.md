I create new db & user to record house information. (3 hours)

I take json format from client for house information (1 hours)

I check client information whether it is valid or not. (8-9 hours)

if it is valid, I record information stable. (6-9 hours)
    I will serve recording-deleting-updating

if it is not valid I have to report what is the prb? (3 hours)

I try to handle all errors in every steps and I'm testing each step. (5 hours)


Totally 26-30 hours.
